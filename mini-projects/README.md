## Mini Projects

My approach is to learn web development by actually building something! No matter how big or small it is.
This folder mainly compiles smaller-scale web development projects that were built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Project ideas stem from the two courses introduced below. In the earlier stage of learning, I coded along the course works.

As I move forward and gain more confidence, I found myself slowly coding for myself ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€  - entire HTML structure and CSS with JavaScript tips from the courses for projects like : **speed-typer**, **meal-finder**, **countdown**, **hangman**, **relaxer-animation**.

To see my work, please find the instruction outlined below. Thanks and enjoy!
