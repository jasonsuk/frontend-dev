## Menu Slider

HTML, CSS and a bit of Java Script used

### Desscription

This project is mainly about animation effects on navigation bar.
The navigation bar is to be placed hidden on the left.

When the toggle button is clicked, navigation bar will slide in, pushing the other body contents to the right.
Key take away is to apply animnation to the **entire** `document.body`.
